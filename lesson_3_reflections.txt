When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-To work online when you don't have access to your local
-To have a copy online
-For collaboration
-For reputation on community
-To have others' suggestions on your project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-There may be several people working on the same project
-It wouldn't be useful to stay online in such cases
-You would want to collaborate at specific points of your modifications

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Branches are different paths on the project
-there could be branches on both repositories
-Forks are repository clones directly on GitHub
-Forks are great to modify existing code for your needs
-Forks are actually clones on Github itself
-And you can clone any public repository to your local
-But if you don't fork it, you wouldn't be able to commit on GitHub
